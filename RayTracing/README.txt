README:

For the creative rendering section we chose to implement a GUI
that allows access to the following features:

1. Opening txt scene descriptors
2. Options for initiating / aborting a rendering process

3. Advanced rendering settings:
	3.1. Setting the resolution
	3.2. Changing the maximum recursion depth for emitted rays
	3.3. Setting the amount of rendering threads
	3.4. Anti-Aliasing via random supersampling in each pixel. Allows setting the number of samples per-pixel

4. Allows setting/modifying scene parameters prior to rendering:
	4.1. Adding specified geometric primitives to the loaded scene
	4.2. Resetting the camera
	4.3. Changing the background color

5. Save the rendered image in your desired location

Have fun! :D
